# Work Experience & Achievements Post-University
ðŸ’» Kick-started my career at GenSight in July 2017, mainly working on spreadsheet development and legacy web applications (MS Excel, VBA, VB.NET)

In 2020, I decided to leave Marie Curie after being offered three jobs. Unfortunately, the accepted offer was pulled a couple of days before the agreed start date due to the pandemic. I had a virtual farewell, and started interviewing virtually. Within a month, I was offered four more jobs

ðŸ’» Involved in suggesting ways to improve how we delivered as a team, recruitment process (writing job specs, CV reviewing & interviewing)
