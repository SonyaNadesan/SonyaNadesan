### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**SonyaNadesan/SonyaNadesan** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I began my journey in computing at Kingston University in 2014 where I made good progress and was offered my first ever role as Academic Mentor and later as a Teaching Assistant. I graduated with a First Class in Software Engineering and was selected along with my twin sister to give the Vote of Thanks during our graduation ceremony. 

Since then, I have worked in the product team at GenSight, working on legacy systems, as well as organising fundraising events for Save The Children and Cancer Research UK (CRUK). In early 2019, I joined the Digital Marketing Team at leading charity, Marie Curie, where I developed skills and knowledge that were more relevant to modern software development. That year, I was shortlisted in The Future Stars of Tech (Developer Category, 2019).

In 2020, I decided to leave Marie Curie after being offered three jobs. Unfortunately, the accepted offer was pulled a couple of days before the agreed start date due to the pandemic. I had a virtual farewell, and started interviewing virtually. Within a month, I was offered four more jobs and decided to join global cybersecurity company, Mimecast (NASDAQ:MIME), working for the Digital Marketing team. I was onboarded remotely and played a key role, taking on major projects as well as suggesting ways to improve how we delivered as a team. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Mimecast and my work was recognised by the senior management within the Global Marketing department. In July 2021, I joined Investment Bank, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) as a Full-Stack Developer in the treasury team and managed to hit-the-ground-running with Angular, despite having little experience in front-end development. I am currently building on my knowledge of SQL as well as other data technologies.
